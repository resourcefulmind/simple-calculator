let runningTotal = 0;

// Next we should have sort of like a buffer, what is on the screen at any given time
let buffer = "0";

// then we need to keep the previous operation in another store, sort of if we add before and we want to subtract now
let previousOperator;

// next we grab the screen

// the init function will be the function that gets called once and sets everything up
function init () {

// then call init
